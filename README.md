# Stockbet Game

#### This game is for investing nerds. Relying only on news on different stocks, can you pick the stock that makes more money than your opponent?

---
## Gameplay

1. Set the parameters of the game: your wallet size (the amount each person has to invest), and your holding period (number of trading days before today).

2. Research stocks by entering ticker names. For now, only stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange are available. Once you enter a valid ticker, the text area below will display recent news related to the ticker.
_(Note to game evaluator: news data not available from within browser due to cross origin issues; the data pulled instead comes from a dummy data in JSON format.)_

3. Based on your research, write up your investment thesis to help you improve over time (optional). Then, enter the ticker of the stock you want to purchase, and click Select Ticker.

4. The second player will repeat steps 2 and 3 above.

5. After both players have entered their stock picks, click Execute Trades to run the database lookup and so determine the winner.

6. Once ready, the results will show at the bottom of the page. __The player whose stock returned the most will be the winner.__
* You may email the results to yourself.
* Use the Facebook button to share the game with your friends!

## Data Sources and NPM Modules

1. Quandl (quandl.com), an API-enabled financial database, is used to pull price data.

2. The google-news npm package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-news) was used to generate the dummy data used in the news research section.
_Specifically, I used the link provided in the browser console error log to view the news data (in XML format), converted the XML into JSON, and saved the JSON file into the project directory. (Note: The original intention was to pull live news for selected stocks, but cross origin issues in the browser forced this workaround with dummy data.)_
