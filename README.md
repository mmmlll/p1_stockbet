## Game Mechanics

Using level 1 as an example:

![Level 1](https://github.com/wdi-sg/wdi-project-1-johnacs/raw/master/assets/readme/level1.jpg)


* each level has a 2D start array (var levelArray) and 2D solution array (var solutionArray).
* there are 6 graphic elements into two rows.
* each graphic element corresponds to a "type".
[See Game Elements below](#game-elements)
For example on the top row, starting from left, graphic is type 11, follow by type 21, type 13.
Therefore from the start array, the graphic elements are populated based on the "type".
* every click rotates the graphic element clock wise.
* each click of the graphic element updates the play Array (var playArray). For example when top left graphic element is click, the playArray[0] is updated to 12, another click would update playArray[0] to 13. play Array (var playArray) is then compared with the solution Array (var solutionArray), if all indices values match, the solution is found.
* there are two special handling for "type" 5 and "type" 0, since they are symmterical in all orientation, there is no need to update the playArray.
* the solution is then displayed (function displaySolution).

#### updatePlayArray ()
* Updates the playArray

#### checkSolution ()
Compares playArray against solutionArray for each click of graphic element, if true, call displaySolution function
```
if (checkSolution() === true) {
    clearGrids()
    displaySolution(currentLevel)
  }
}
```
